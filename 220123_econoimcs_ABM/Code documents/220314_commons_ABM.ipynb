    "   - how can we compare it reasonably to the capitalism one? Current feedback from the capitalism one is that it is too reductionist. I am using perfectly rational actors in perfect competition. This is a bit of a simplistic framework so I'll eventually need to bring this up to a level where people are interacting in more reasonable ways. Especially bc I want this one to be more reasonable. \n",

    "    - I want to use outcomes such as - resiliency. How does the system react to perterbations (modeled by some as reductions in flow of common resource - wonder what other things could be modeled this way? And are we thinking about this in a 'flow regime' type way - ie this happens consistently, or in more a natural disaster type way? \n",
