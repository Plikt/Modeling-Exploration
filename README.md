## Carbon Sequestration

We are shuttling carbon into the atmosphere faster than the earthâ€™s natural carbon sequestration systems can remove it. While reducing this carbon output is essential, just as important to manage the carbon in the air. One method that aims to reduce this carbon is using the natural mechanism of trees to sequester carbon. 
In response to research that young-growth forests were more effective at sequestering carbon a company called Sealaska has recently begun advocating to a) remove old-growth forests and replace them with young-growth ones and b) sell carbon credits for the increased carbon sequestration to companies in the lower 48 states. To evaluate this policy recommendation further, I will estimate the change in carbon sequestration for a) a young forest on empty land, b) a young forest on currently forested land, and c) an old forest.
